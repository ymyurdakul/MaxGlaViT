MaxGlaViT: A Lightweight Vision Transformer for Glaucoma Stage Diagnosis
This repository contains the implementation of MaxGlaViT, a lightweight Vision Transformer designed for glaucoma stage classification. The model incorporates advanced deep learning components for enhanced performance and efficiency.

$Key Features
ConvNeXtV2 Integration: Advanced convolutional blocks replace traditional MBConv structures in MaxViT blocks.
Efficient Channel Attention (ECA): Integrated in the stem block for improved feature emphasis.
Optimized Design: Scaled MaxViT architecture reduces complexity while maintaining robust performance.
